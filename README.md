# CUSTOMER-DATA


# Project Title: ðŸ“Š Customer Segmentation Analysis for Subscription Service

## Introduction: Setting the Scene
In todayâ€™s competitive subscription market, understanding customer behavior is key to reducing churn and driving growth. This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a subscription service to identify trends, segment customers, and uncover insights into cancellations and renewals. By analyzing this data, we can help the business improve customer retention, optimize marketing strategies, and increase revenue.

## Project Goals

#### We aimed to address the following questions:

- What regions have the highest and lowest customer counts?
- Which subscription types are most popular, and which ones are driving revenue?
- Are there patterns in subscription cancellations, and which regions see the highest cancellation rates?
- What is the typical subscription duration, and who are the loyal customers with long-term subscriptions? "

3. Data Exploration and Preparation

Describe how you explored and cleaned the data in Excel and SQL. Explain the steps you took to make the data ready for analysis, such as calculating subscription duration or identifying key metrics. Example:

    "Our initial analysis focused on cleaning and understanding the raw customer data. By creating pivot tables in Excel, we could quickly view basic subscription patterns and identify areas for deeper analysis. For example, we calculated each customerâ€™s subscription duration and identified the most popular subscription types, providing a foundation for segmentation and trend analysis."

4. SQL Insights: Delving into the Data

Summarize the insights you extracted using SQL. You could present each query as a mini-story that explains what you wanted to learn and what you discovered. Hereâ€™s an example:

    "In SQL, we tackled key questions by writing queries to isolate important trends:

        Popular Subscription Types: By counting unique customers per subscription type, we found that our Standard Plan is the most popular, covering over 40% of all subscriptions.
        High Churn Regions: Our analysis revealed that Region B has the highest number of cancellations. This region accounted for over 30% of all canceled subscriptions, suggesting it may require targeted retention strategies.
        Subscription Duration: We calculated the average subscription duration and found that customers typically stay subscribed for about 10 months. However, some high-value customers have subscribed for more than 12 months, indicating potential for loyalty incentives."

5. Power BI Dashboard: Visualizing the Story

Describe the design and purpose of your Power BI dashboard. Explain how each visualization helps tell a specific part of the story, and how it allows stakeholders to explore the data interactively.

    "To make our findings actionable, we developed an interactive Power BI dashboard. Hereâ€™s what it includes:

        Customer Overview: A map showing customer distribution by region, allowing easy identification of our most and least active areas.
        Subscription Trends: A bar chart displaying total revenue by subscription type, highlighting our most profitable plans.
        Cancellations Analysis: A pie chart to show the proportion of active vs. canceled subscriptions, and a bar chart of cancellations by region, enabling teams to identify cancellation hotspots.
        Interactive Slicers: Slicers for region, subscription type, and status allow users to explore specific segments dynamically, offering insights at a granular level."

6. Key Insights and Recommendations

Summarize your findings and suggest data-driven actions. This is where you connect your analysis back to the business goals and propose potential strategies.

    "Based on our analysis, we recommend the following actions:

        Targeted Retention Campaigns: Since Region B shows a high churn rate, we suggest a targeted retention campaign focusing on this area, including personalized incentives and offers.
        Focus on High-Value Plans: With the Premium Plan generating significant revenue, a customer success program could encourage upgrades and longer commitments.
        Loyalty Program for Long-Term Subscribers: For customers with subscriptions over 12 months, introduce a loyalty program to reward their commitment and further reduce churn risk."

7. Technical Documentation

Hereâ€™s where you can add details about how each part of the project was built. This includes:

    Excel: Briefly describe the pivot tables and calculations you used.
    SQL Queries: Add each SQL query with comments, explaining its purpose.
    Power BI Dashboard: Include screenshots or descriptions of each visual, highlighting how to interact with the dashboard.

8. Conclusion: Reflecting on the Impact

Wrap up with a reflection on the value of your analysis. Describe how the insights from this project could benefit the business over the long term.

    "This project highlights the power of data analysis in understanding and improving customer relationships. By identifying key segments, tracking subscription patterns, and analyzing cancellation trends, the business is now equipped with data-backed insights to increase retention, enhance customer experience, and drive growth."
